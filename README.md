# My Golang journey

Some notes, examples, and solutions to problems I've encountered while learning Go. Some useful snippets were taken out to separate packages and repositories on GitHub. I'll leave most useful links here, so I can easily find them later.

## Books & Tutorials

- ["Concurrency in Go. Tools and Techniques for Developers" by Katherine Cox-Buday](https://github.com/parMaster/go-solutions/blob/main/sandbox/Concurrency_in_Go_test.go) - notes and examples from the book, some concurrency-related examples from Ultimate Go Programming course by Bill Kennedy. Testing patterns, writing tests for concurrent code, and more.

## Workshops

- [Binary Tree Algorithms for Technical Interviews](https://github.com/parMaster/go-solutions/blob/main/sandbox/Binary_tree_algorithm_for_technical_interview_test.go) exploring binary tree algos from the Alvin's workshop (node -> go) [https://youtu.be/fAAZixBzIAI](https://youtu.be/fAAZixBzIAI)

- [Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges](https://github.com/parMaster/go-solutions/blob/main/sandbox/Dynamic_programming_workshop_test.go) - Node workshop examples written in Go
