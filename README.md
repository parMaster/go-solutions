# My Golang journey

Some notes, examples, and solutions to problems I've encountered while learning Go. Some useful snippets were taken out to separate packages and repositories on GitHub. I'll leave most useful links here, so I can easily find them later.

## Books & Tutorials

- ["Concurrency in Go. Tools and Techniques for Developers" by Katherine Cox-Buday](tree/main/sandbox/Concurrency_in_Go_test.go) - notes and examples from the book

## Various workshops
