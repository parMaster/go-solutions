## Exploring Go by Example (https://gobyexample.com/)

Generally, I try to copy the example, explore it, run, debug, try some different ways, comment some parts
and try to understand what's going on. After I think I can explain everything to the bystander, I go back
to original explanation and check if I got it right.

Turn off Copilot for better effect.
